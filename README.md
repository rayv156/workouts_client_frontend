# Workout Log App

This web app was made to help track and take notes on workouts.  There have been so many times in the past where I do the same workout weeks later and wonder how much progress I had made since then.  This app will allow users to look back on those notes and be able to compare their current results to past results.  The app uses Rails in the backend and React in the frontend with jwt authentication.  If you got into a funk during the last few months, get back in shape with this app and track your progress!

## Features

This app has the following features:

### `View Workouts`

The user can look up some at-home workouts and check in on the difficulty levels.

### `Log Workouts`

Allows the user to log each workout and take some notes on how they felt during and after.

### `Weekly Weigh In`

This feature is coming soon and will automatically prompt the user to post a weight after a week has gone by.

### `Add workouts to favorites`

This feature is coming soon as well.  It will allow the user to save the workouts in a favorite page and give it a name.
